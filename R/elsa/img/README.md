## About statistical Analysis

This section is dedicated to statistical analyses divided into two parts: Descriptive and non-parametric. The descriptive part analyzed the data, performed initial treatments, and subsequently created graphs in which one or two variables appeared in combination. Non-parametric statistics were an alternative to classical methods because the analyzed data did not have a normal distribution, and thus, the data were analyzed using the Friedman and Wilcoxon methods (both paired). There is a section dedicated to time series and correlations of pollution analyses.

It is hoped that these results can help in the perception of patterns and indices that relate pollution to kidney diseases.

## Time series analysis

Time series analysis involves the study of datasets that are ordered sequentially over time. The primary goal is to understand the underlying structure and function that produced the observations, and to forecast future values. In this project, time series analysis was used to study trends and patterns in the data related to pollution and kidney disease variables over time.
